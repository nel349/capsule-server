# CapsuleX Semantic Evaluation Plan 🎯

## Project Goal
Build a robust evaluation framework for semantic answer checking in CapsuleX games. Learn ML evaluation best practices while creating a production-ready system.

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic semantic service running (Flask + Sentence Transformers)
- ✅ Initial testing shows mixed results
- 🔄 Ready to dive deep into evaluations!

## Initial Test Results (Baseline)
```
Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2, Threshold: 0.8

✅ Exact matches: pizza=pizza (1.00)
✅ Direct synonyms: car=automobile (0.865)
❌ Descriptions: "italian flatbread with cheese"=pizza (0.444)
❌ Complex descriptions: "big cat with stripes"=tiger (0.415)
✅ Obviously wrong: "completely wrong"=pizza (0.102)
```

## Evaluation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Target: 1-2 hours)
**Goal**: Build structured evaluation framework

#### 1.1 Create Test Dataset 📊
- [ ] Design test case categories
- [ ] Collect 50+ diverse answer pairs
- [ ] Include edge cases and real game scenarios
- [ ] Format as structured JSON/CSV

**Categories to Include:**
- Exact matches
- Direct synonyms  
- Descriptive phrases
- Cultural references
- Emoji/visual descriptions
- Common misspellings
- Metaphors and idioms
- Obviously wrong answers

#### 1.2 Build Evaluation Metrics 📈
- [ ] Implement precision/recall calculation
- [ ] Add confusion matrix visualization
- [ ] Create threshold optimization
- [ ] Statistical significance testing

**Key Metrics:**
- Accuracy
- Precision (true positives / predicted positives)
- Recall (true positives / actual positives)  
- F1-score (harmonic mean of precision/recall)
- Area Under Curve (AUC)

#### 1.3 Threshold Analysis 🎛️
- [ ] Test thresholds from 0.1 to 0.9
- [ ] Find optimal balance point
- [ ] Category-specific threshold recommendations
- [ ] Generate threshold vs accuracy curves

### Phase 2: Model Comparison (Target: 2-3 hours)
**Goal**: Find the best model for CapsuleX use cases

#### 2.1 Multi-Model Testing 🤖
Models to evaluate:
- [ ] `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (current, 90MB)
- [ ] `all-mpnet-base-v2` (420MB, higher quality)
- [ ] `all-distilroberta-v1` (290MB, good balance)
- [ ] `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` (for international users)

#### 2.2 Performance Analysis 📊
- [ ] Speed benchmarks (responses/second)
- [ ] Memory usage comparison
- [ ] Accuracy by category comparison
- [ ] Cost/benefit analysis for deployment

#### 2.3 Confidence Scoring 🎯
- [ ] Implement confidence intervals
- [ ] Identify "uncertain" predictions (0.6-0.8 range)
- [ ] Design fallback strategies for low confidence

### Phase 3: Real-World Integration (Ongoing)
**Goal**: Deploy and continuously improve

#### 3.1 Data Collection Pipeline 📥
- [ ] Add logging to production service
- [ ] Capture user guess patterns
- [ ] Store disputed answers for review
- [ ] Privacy-compliant data collection

#### 3.2 Feedback Mechanisms 🔄
- [ ] User "dispute answer" button
- [ ] Creator can mark accepted alternatives
- [ ] Community voting on edge cases
- [ ] ML retraining pipeline

#### 3.3 Advanced Features 🚀
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Domain-specific models (sports, movies, etc.)
- [ ] Contextual answer checking
- [ ] Integration with LLM for edge cases

## Learning Objectives 🎓

### ML/AI Concepts
- [ ] **Evaluation Metrics**: Understanding precision, recall, F1
- [ ] **Threshold Optimization**: ROC curves, optimal cutoffs

- [ ] **Continuous Learning**: Feedback loops

### Engineering Practices
- [ ] **A/B Testing**: Compare model versions
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Track model performance over time
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback strategies
- [ ] **Scalability**: Handle increasing load
- [ ] **Documentation**: Reproducible experiments

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success:
- [ ] 90%+ accuracy on exact matches and direct synonyms
- [ ] 70%+ accuracy on descriptive phrases
- [ ] Clear threshold recommendation with justification
- [ ] Comprehensive test dataset (50+ cases)

### Phase 2 Success:
- [ ] Model recommendation with performance justification
- [ ] Sub-200ms response time for chosen model
- [ ] Confidence scoring for uncertain cases
- [ ] Clear deployment strategy

### Phase 3 Success:
- [ ] Production logging and monitoring
- [ ] User feedback integration
- [ ] Measurable improvement over time
- [ ] Scalable to 1000+ daily evaluations

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Create test_dataset.json** with categorized answer pairs
2. **Build eval_framework.py** with core metrics
3. **Run baseline evaluation** with current model
4. **Optimize threshold** based on results
5. **Document findings** and plan next phase

## Questions to Explore

- What accuracy is "good enough" for a game?
- How do we balance false positives vs false negatives?
- Should different game types have different thresholds?
- How do we handle cultural/regional answer variations?
- What's the right confidence threshold for human review?
