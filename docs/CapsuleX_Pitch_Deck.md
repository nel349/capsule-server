More from other conversations:
1. Web2 schedulers focus on repetitive posting‚ÄîCapsuleX‚Äôs time capsule mechanic is a one-off, event-driven hook. Double down on gamifying the scheduler with unlock events or surprise reveals to make it feel less like a utility and more like an experience. 2. Add social virality‚ÄîBuffer and Hootsuite are functional but lack community buzz. CapsuleX could let users share capsule teasers or invite friends to guess outcomes, driving engagement Web2 can‚Äôt match. 3. Blockchain edge‚ÄîPlainly and others don‚Äôt offer NFT rewards or on-chain permanence. Highlight CapsuleX‚Äôs ability to mint unique NFTs for top predictors or capsule creators to draw crypto-curious users. 4. User experience‚ÄîWeb2 platforms can feel clunky for casual users. Make CapsuleX‚Äôs interface sleeker, with one-tap scheduling and wallet-free onboarding for non-crypto folks.
