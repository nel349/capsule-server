## Revenue Model: Dual-Stream Architecture

### **Primary Revenue: "Quarter" Model**
**Philosophy**: Impulse purchase pricing familiar to mobile gamers

```
Guess Fee: $0.25 per guess
Revenue Split: 60% creator ($0.15) / 40% platform ($0.10)
Psychology: Cost of arcade game or candy bar
Target: High-volume, low-friction participation
```

**Why $0.25 Works for Mainstream:**
- Impulse purchase threshold
- No crypto complexity (just "pay to play")
- Familiar mobile game micro-transaction pricing
- Low enough for repeated engagement

### **Secondary Revenue: Market-Rate NFT Achievement System**
**Philosophy**: Premium collectibles for engaged users

```
Achievement Badges: $1.00 per mint
Milestone Trophies: $5.00 per mint  
Special/Rare Trophies: $10.00 per mint
Market Positioning: Competitive with gaming NFT standards
```

**Market Research Justification:**
- Magic Eden (top Solana marketplace): $0.50-$5+ for achievement NFTs
- Gaming badge collections: $1-$10 typical range
- Trophy/milestone NFTs: $5-$25 for significant achievements
- **Result**: 1000x revenue increase over previous micro-fees

### **Tertiary Revenue: Service Fees**
```
Capsule Creation: $0.008 (operational cost coverage)
Premium Features: $0.004 (minimal service fees)
Impact: <1% of total revenue (operational only)
```
