## Revenue Model: Triple-Stream Architecture

### **Primary Revenue: "Quarter" Model (Gaming)**
**Philosophy**: Impulse purchase pricing familiar to mobile gamers

```
Guess Fee: $0.25 per guess
Revenue Split: 60% creator ($0.15) / 40% platform ($0.10)
Psychology: Cost of arcade game or candy bar
Target: High-volume, low-friction participation
```

**Why $0.25 Works for Mainstream:**
- Impulse purchase threshold
- No crypto complexity (just "pay to play")
- Familiar mobile game micro-transaction pricing
- Low enough for repeated engagement

### **Secondary Revenue: Time Capsules + Social Scheduler (Dual-Mode Platform)**
**Philosophy**: Premium blockchain experiences + accessible social scheduling

```
Time Capsules: Blockchain storage + encryption + automatic real content posting
- Regular: $0.35 (blockchain + encryption + automated posting of actual content)
- Gamified: $0.50 (everything above + AI gaming + semantic validation)

Social Scheduler: Simple Twitter scheduling without blockchain
- Basic: $0.25 (direct Twitter posting + API optimization)
```

**Phase 1: Basic Tier Implementation (100-150 Users)**
```
