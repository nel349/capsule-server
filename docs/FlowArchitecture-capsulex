‚è∫ Perfect. Let's define the exact happy path flow with all the details before we write any code.

  Simple CapsuleX Happy Path Flow

  1. User Arrives at CapsuleX

  - Landing page: "Schedule tweets for the future, guaranteed by blockchain"
  - CTA: "Create Your First Time Capsule"
  I like this. Let's think about getting the user ready for the "aha" moment. Meaning they understand how this product works and how its ggonna solve them what they want in this case entertainment.

  2. Authentication

  - Option A: Connect Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare)
  - Option B: Should we also support email/social login? Or wallet-only for true decentralization?
  - Question: Do we require X/Twitter connection immediately or later?

  Lets have both A and B. but lets make the option B more prominent since we expect mainstream users to arrive(normie people). For option B I would like to use something like Privy which solves the wallet proble and we don't have to worrry about the custody. for OptionA we expect experts to alsor arrive. 

  as for the X/Twitter social connection, it could be Farcaster in the future. Let's have another "setup page" where we have boxes that tell the users the required and the optional elements for starting a capsule. in our case the required would be X and some other optional would be Farcaster, and other supported social media in the future. 

  3. Create Capsule Flow

  UI Form Fields:
  - Tweet content (280 char limit)
  - Reveal date/time picker
  - Optional: Add image/media? yes optional. 
  - Preview: Shows exactly how tweet will look when posted. Yes.

  Backend Process:
  - Encrypt content client-side or server-side? what would save use more compute power? client side right?
  - Call your createCapsule smart contract function. yes
  - Store in database: {content_encrypted, reveal_date, user_wallet, on_chain_tx}

  Questions:
  - Do we charge the SOL fee immediately? yes
  - Do we store encrypted content on-chain or just hash? we have more information on the docs. please check.
  - What's the minimum/maximum reveal delay? (1 hour to 1 year?) 1 hour to 1 year. for testing purposes 5 seconds to 1 hour.

  4. Confirmation State

  - "Capsule created! Your tweet will be revealed on [DATE]"
  - Show transaction ID, countdown timer
  - Social proof: "Share that you created a time capsule" (without revealing content)

  5. Waiting Period

  Public Timeline:
  - Other users can see "Someone scheduled a tweet for [DATE]" (without content)
  - Countdown timers for upcoming reveals
  - Question: Should there be social features? Comments, likes, predictions? No. the user can see their comments or likes on the X post.

  6. Reveal Time

  Automated Process:
  - Scheduler detects reveal_date has passed
  - Calls smart contract revealCapsule
  - Decrypts content
  - Critical: Posts to user's connected X account
  - Updates database: revealed_at, posted_to_x, x_post_id

  User Experience:
  - Email/push notification: "Your capsule just revealed!"
  - Link to both the X post and CapsuleX reveal page

  7. Post-Reveal

  - Public reveal page showing the tweet + proof of when it was created
  - Link between X post and CapsuleX for verification
  - Social features: Others can see the reveal, react, comment

  Critical Questions to Define:

  X Integration Details

  1. When does user connect their X account? During signup or just before first reveal? Like we said before we will have a setup page where the user can connect their X account right after signup. if they skip it, it will be required before they can create a capsule.
  2. What if X API fails during reveal? Retry logic? yes very simple retry logic.
  3. Should the X post include a CapsuleX signature/link for proof? yes.

  Content Storage

  1. Store full encrypted content on-chain (expensive) or just hash + off-chain storage? we have more information on the docs. please check. it depends on the size of the content and other factors.
  2. Client-side encryption (user controls key) or server-side (we manage)? we have more information on the docs. please check. the user controls the key.
  3. What happens if user loses wallet access before reveal? not sure about this. but we should thinkg about it later. make a bullet point for it.

  Timing & Fees

  1. Minimum reveal delay for demo vs. production?
  2. Do we charge the SOL fee upfront or on reveal?
  3. What if user doesn't have SOL for reveal transaction?

  Error Handling

  1. What if user deletes X account before reveal?
  2. What if smart contract call fails?
  3. Should users be able to cancel/edit capsules before reveal?

  Which of these details should we nail down first? The X integration flow seems most critical for the demo.
